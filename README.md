📖 Introduction
The Receipt App is a smart budgeting and price prediction tool built to support UK university students facing the cost of living crisis. It helps users compare supermarket prices, track inflation trends, and generate grocery lists tailored to their budget and location.

Whether you're planning a weekly shop or looking for the cheapest essentials, Receipt gives you real-time, AI-assisted, and location-aware recommendations — all in one platform.

💡 Offline-ready datasets are available in the /Supermarket data folder in case the live database is unavailable.
