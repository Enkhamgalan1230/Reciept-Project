### Project Overview: Smart Budgeting and Price Prediction App for University Students

**Introduction**

In light of the ongoing cost of living crisis, many university students in the UK are facing
increasing financial pressures. The need for effective budgeting tools has never been more
critical. To address this issue, I propose developing a Smart Budgeting and Price Prediction
App tailored specifically for university students. This app will assist users in managing their
expenses, comparing grocery prices, and anticipating future price changes, empowering them
to make informed purchasing decisions. 

### Key Features and Functionality

**1. Personalised Budget Management**

o The app will analyse each user's monthly income and spending patterns to
generate personalised budget recommendations.
o Users can input their financial data, including income sources, fixed expenses
(such as rent), and discretionary spending, allowing the app to create a
customised budget.

**2. Smart Shopping List Generator**

o Based on the user's financial profile, the app will generate a list of essential
items to purchase each month.
o It will allow users to categorise items based on necessity, helping them prioritise
spending and avoid unnecessary purchases.

**3. Real-Time Price Comparison**

o The app will integrate APIs from major UK grocery retailers to provide real-time
price comparisons across diƯerent stores.
o Users can search for specific products and view price variations, ensuring they
make the most cost-eƯective choices when shopping.

**4. Price Prediction and Alerts**

o Utilising machine learning algorithms, the app will analyse historical pricing data
to predict future price trends for essential items.
o Users will receive alerts about anticipated price increases, especially during
high-demand seasons, enabling them to plan their purchases accordingly.

**5. Data-Driven Recommendations**

o The app will leverage AI to provide insights into user spending habits and
recommend ways to optimise budgets.
o It will suggest when to buy in bulk or switch to more aƯordable alternatives
based on price trends.

**6. User-Friendly Interface**

o The app will feature an intuitive design tailored to the preferences of university
students, making it easy to navigate and input data.
o It will provide visualisations of spending habits, allowing users to track their
budgets eƯectively.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience for this app is university students in the UK who are seeking
eƯective tools to manage their finances in a challenging economic environment. The app aims
to empower students by providing them with valuable financial insights and cost-saving
strategies.
