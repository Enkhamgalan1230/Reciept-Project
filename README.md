### Project Overview: Smart Budgeting and Price Prediction App for University Students

**Introduction**

In light of the ongoing cost of living crisis, many university students in the UK are facing
increasing financial pressures. The need for effective budgeting tools has never been more
critical. To address this issue, I propose developing a Smart Budgeting and Price Prediction
App tailored specifically for university students. This app will assist users in managing their
expenses, comparing grocery prices, and anticipating future price changes, empowering them
to make informed purchasing decisions. 

### Key Features and Functionality

**1. Price Comparison**

* The app retrieves the most recent grocery prices from major UK supermarkets, using either integrated APIs or regularly updated scraped data stored in session state.
* Users can compare the prices of up to 15 popular items side by side across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Waitrose, and Sainsbury’s, with a clear display of the cheapest option for each product.
* Products are visualised in a bar chart format, enabling users to quickly identify price differences and make cost-effective choices.
* Even when a product is not available in certain stores, the system accounts for this by indicating missing data while maintaining consistent layout and comparison structure.
* An advanced search functionality allows users to filter items by subcategory, store, or specific keywords. The comparison table displays the filtered results sorted by price, along with units and discount prices, enabling precise and informed decision-making.





### Target Audience

The primary target audience for this app is university students in the UK who are seeking
eƯective tools to manage their finances in a challenging economic environment. The app aims
to empower students by providing them with valuable financial insights and cost-saving
strategies.
